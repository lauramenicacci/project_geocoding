# European Import-Export Geoanalysis
project_geocoding

# Introduction
The Covid-18 pandemic generated a deep crisis in the transportation sector due to the long break in imports and exports among countries. Consequences of such crisis are still visible now, two years after the Covid-19 outbreak started, and they do not seem to finish now, as energy shortages and delivery delays have become a daily occurrence in the European Union member states. 
We are therefore interested in investigating how flows of goods from and to the European Union changed over time, and whether the impact of the Covid crisi can be visible through mapping import and export values. We decided to focus our research on the trade activity of the EU member countries, the USA and BRICS countries. 
Our idea is to show the economic value of goods imported and exported by sea every month by every EU member state in and from the 10 partners. The output consists of a dynamic representation of the commercial relations between such countries. The analysis is limited to the years 2020 and 2021, with a final visualization of the monetary size of imports and exports in every month of the two selected years as well as the routes between the countries.

# Description of results
 - The dots represent the value of total imports (exports) of each EU country for each month of the selected years. 
 - The lines instead represent the value of goods imported (exported) by each EU country from (to) each trading partner. 
 - The thickness of the lines change according to the value of goods traded in each month of the selected years. 

# User interaction
The user can select the states between which she wants to see the exports and imports relationships. 

# Tools
We used the following packages: pandas, plotly express.

# Goals of the project
 - Show the economic size of export and import via maritime transportation 
 - Analyse economic trends between EU and BRICS countries along a specific period of time
 - Make data and maps available for the user to select countries of interest
