# European Import-Export Geoanalysis

# Introduction
The Covid-19 pandemic generated a deep crisis in maritime transportation sector due to the long break in imports and exports among countries. Consequences of such crisis are still visible now, two years after the Covid-19 outbreak started, and they do not seem to finish now, as energy shortages and delivery delays have become a daily occurrence in the European Union member states. 
We are therefore interested in investigating how flows of goods from and to the European Union changed over time, and whether the impact of the Covid crisis can be visible through mapping import and export values. We decided to focus our research on the trade activity of the EU member countries, the USA and BRICS countries.
The ultimate aim of this project is to illustrate the economic value of goods imported and exported by sea every month by every EU member state in and from the 10 partners, in order to be able to draw conclusions and proper observations. 
The output consists of a dynamic representation of the commercial relations between such countries. The analysis is limited to the years 2020 and 2021, with a final visualization of the monetary size of imports and exports in every month of the two selected years as well as the routes between the countries.

# Resources
[Eurostat database](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/transport/data/database)

Such sources include the flows (import and export) values represented in euros that has been transported via sea. 

# Final output
 - The bubbles represent the value of total imports (exports) of each EU country for each month of the selected timeframe. 
 - The colour of the bubbles explains the different EU partners 
 - The slider interactively illustrates the change of M/X over time. 

# User interaction
The user can select the countries from the legend to see the exports and imports relationships and contribution to single EU member states.

# Tools
The following packages have been used: 
 - pandas
 - plotly express.

# Goals of the project
 - Show the economic size of export and import via maritime transportation 
 - Analyse economic trends between EU and BRICS countries along a specific period of time
 - Make data and maps available for the user to select countries of interest
